## Definition

A method for building a design system in five stages that Brad Frost published in 2016. The stages run at the same time, not in sequence:

1. Atoms: the basic elements, such as a label, an input, or a button.
2. Molecules: simple groups of atoms that work as one unit, such as a search form.
3. Organisms: complex components that form a section of an interface, such as a header.
4. Templates: layouts that place components and show the structure of the content.
5. Pages: templates with real, representative content, which test the system.
