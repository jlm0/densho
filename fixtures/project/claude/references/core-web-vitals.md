## Definition

Three measures of the experience of real users on a web page, from Google. Largest Contentful Paint measures loading, and is good at `2.5` seconds or less. Interaction to Next Paint measures the response to input, and is good at `200` milliseconds or less. Cumulative Layout Shift measures visual stability, and is good at `0.1` or less. Google measures each target at the 75th percentile of page loads, for mobile and desktop apart.
